abstract="Rescue robotics, aerial mapping, and information sourcing systems are a few of the many advancements in disaster management that have been developed using AI. AI has provided rescue crews access to disaster-stricken zones without any risks of injury or fatigue. In this chapter we will discuss how AI is modernizing disaster management, and review successful applications of robotics and machine learning in supporting recovery operations during recent disasters. We will also review various companies and products that are commercially available today and how they can easily be adopted to modernize a country's disaster management infrastructure. The latter section of this chapter also discusses the use of machine learning in predicting disasters and highlights advantages in terms of accuracy, implementation, and cost. Lastly this chapter discusses how AI can get biased and provides some recommendations to be considered with adopting AI in disaster management.",
